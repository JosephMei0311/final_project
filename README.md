## Project Title: Scuffed Dino Game
### Contributors: Joseph Mei, Timothy Young
### Period: 1

### Description:
This game is basically a replica of the Google Dino Run game but with extra functions to spice it up. There are the basic elements of a player located on the left side of the screen and obstacles randomly spawning on the right side that move towards the player for the player to jump over. For our Scuffed Dino Game, however, we included 4 different obstacles for the player to avoid: regular cactuses,  long cactuses, trees, and clouds. In addition to jumping, the player can also drop, or fall down quicker, so that the user can have more control over their gameplay. Like the Google Dino Run game, there is a score and highscore feature that is displayed on the top right of the screen, and the obstacles also speed up as the game progresses to make the game more challenging. To make the game more fun though, we added random power-ups that spawn and can be picked up to give buffs and debuffs to the player, such as high-jumps, invulnerability, and drunkenness. We also have 3 different texture packs for the user to select from that will change the skins of the players and the obstacles, which include a kawaii pack, a Pokemon pack, and a Minecraft pack. There is also a control screen that displays the controls and obstacles for the game.

### Disclaimer:
All required libraries needed to run the game are already within the the repository, so users do not have to download anything after cloning the repository.
